Software improvements without hardware implementation on the PCB
* Analog pin A0 is sampled (relative to internal 1.1V refernce)
* DAC channel 3 produces an analog laser modulation signal 0-5V (8 bit resolution)
* Digital pin 3 outputs a 500Hz PWM signal whose duty cycle is proportional to
  laser power (8-bit resolution)

Wanted hardware improvements
* Install a current sense resisitor and isolation amplifier (AD202 unity
  configuration) to connect to A0. This will allow continued isolated
  current measurement if wanted
* Add two LEDS - one for init OK and one for Laser On
* Expose the LASER pin to an external header, not just to the relay
